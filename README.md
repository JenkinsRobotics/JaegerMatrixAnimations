### General Information
This repository hosts media files for Jaeger matrix animations, including GIFs and BMPs. The project provides animations for a 64x64 LED matrix display. Each file is carefully curated for optimal performance on the hardware setup, ensuring smooth and visually appealing animations.

### Libraries Used
- **SmartMatrix Library**: Used for controlling the LED matrix.
- **SD Library**: Handles SD card operations to load and manage media files.
- **GifDecoder Library**: Specifically for decoding and displaying GIF files on the LED matrix.

### Hardware Used
- **Microcontroller**: Teensy 4.1
- **LED Matrix**: 64x64 RGB LED matrix with HUB75 interface
- **SD Card**: Built-in SD card reader on Teensy 4.1

### Supported File Types
- **GIF**: For animated images, providing smooth transitions and effects.
- **BMP**: For static images or sprite sheets, used for displaying still frames or simple animations.

### Project File Structure
1. **GIFs**: Contains animated GIF files designed for 64x64 display.
2. **BMPs**: Includes BMP files for static images and sprite sheets.
3. **Sprites**: Larger BMP files for sprite-based animations.

### Next Steps
- Continue to add and refine animations.
- Optimize file loading and memory usage.
- Explore new animation techniques and effects.

### Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Upload to SD Card**: Transfer the required media files to an SD card.
3. **Run the Code**: Use the provided Arduino sketches to display the animations on the LED matrix.
